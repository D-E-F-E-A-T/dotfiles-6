# dotfiles

For years I've not posted my dotfiles in a public repo. I've reached a point where I can't hoard this stuff any more. Hopefully someone can find this stuff useful. As this is not my actual dotfiles repo, but the public version, updates may be infrequent but I'll do what I can. In the meantime, feel free to open issues and submit pull requests. Anything you find here is MIT licensed, so use and abuse to your heart's content.

I use Arcolinux as a base distro, so a lot of these configs came from there.
